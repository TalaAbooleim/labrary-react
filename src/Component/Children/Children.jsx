This experience combined with his personal journey learning to program inspired his widely praised guide, The Self-Taught Programmer. Now Corys back with another guide for the self-taught community of learners focusing on the foundations of computer science.' },

Computer science is a massive subject that could cover an entire lifetime of learning. This book does not aim to cover everything you would learn about if you went to school to get a computer science degree. Instead, Corys goal is to give you an introduction to some of the most important concepts in computer science that apply to a programming career. With a focus on data structures and algorithms, The Self-Taught Computer Scientist helps you fill gaps in your knowledge, prepare for a technical interview, feel knowledgeable and confident on the job, and ultimately, become a better programmer.' },
